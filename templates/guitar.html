    <p>The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, A plectrum or individual finger picks may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.
